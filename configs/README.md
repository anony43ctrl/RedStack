# `configs/` — Declarative System Behavior

Everything in this directory is **human-authored intent**, never machine-generated, and never read directly by the online ranking run except for plain runtime/IO knobs. See [`/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md#9-configuration-architecture) for why that distinction matters.

> **The hard rule.** `configs/` is *intent*; `artifacts/` is *derived fact*. Behavior-defining configuration here (scoring weights, the lexicon seed, semantic anchors, eligibility gates, honeypot rule shapes) is **authored** in this directory but **compiled or calibrated** by the offline build into its frozen counterpart under `artifacts/`. The online ranking run never reads `configs/weights/`, `configs/lexicon/`, `configs/anchors/`, `configs/gates/`, or `configs/integrity/` — only their `artifacts/` counterparts. It reads only `configs/base.yaml`, `configs/runtime/online.yaml`, and the active profile.

## Resolution order

Configuration is resolved as a deterministic three-layer deep merge, later layers overriding earlier ones:

```text
base.yaml  →  runtime/{online|offline}.yaml  →  profiles/{ci|local}.yaml
```

Every YAML file maps to a `pydantic` v2 model in `src/redstack/config/schema.py` with `extra="forbid"` — an unrecognized key fails the load loudly instead of silently doing nothing.
